        <p><em>Student and fresher in the world of Technology</em></p>
        <p>
          I am a student at the <strong><a href="https://www.iare.ac.in/">Institute of Aeronautical Engineering</a></strong>, currently specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
          I am a hard working student and a passionate worker whenever it comes to studies and I have been interested in the technology world even before I joined the Institute as a student.
          I have been coding on various websites that give me the option to compete in competitive coding competitions and also let me learn a bunch of stuff that helps me in becoming a better coder overall.
          I am also currently learning Web Development, as it provides me with the career option as a frontend developer in any big organisation and also allows me to code a website of my own in whatever way I want to.
          I am a very athletic person and love to play all kinds of sports even if I don't know how to play it.
